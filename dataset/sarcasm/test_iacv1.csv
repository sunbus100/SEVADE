That sentence doesn't even make sense. Did it occur to you that you should actually think about what you are going to say and express actual ideas?,0

You haven't proven anything. All you have done is spew your same old drivel which ignores what I actually say and reinterprets it to mean what you want it to say. You must corrupt what I say since you can't accept the truth of my beliefs and win your fallacious argument.,0
"Then a man who needs an artificial heart to survive is a new species of man. That is the analogy I gave, and you ignored.   In both cases; human and bacteria, before the advent of a human product, a particular group of individuals from each larger group would die off.   BUT along come a man-made invention that allows those certain portions to live on which otherwise would have died. In once case - nylon, the other, the artificial heart. You call this evolution.   Nor is it 'natural selection' at work either, as in both cases the thing that enabled them to survive was not natural. What you have advanced as a proof of evolution actually proves what? Natural what? I suppose people with cochlear implants are new species too because they've learnt to hear.   Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...   ""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria.""   ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""   http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.asp   Talkorigins gave their usual doubletalk   ""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""   Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htm   One poster on another forum summed the problem up like this...   "" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.   The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantages   But, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.   So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?   If nylon eating bacteria was ""proof"" of evolution, we would still be pond scum, but with the ability to digest whatever happened to become the primary food source.""   http://www.christianforums.com/t52336",0

"But when some are ignorant enough to believe in a false science like evolution, which is based on lies and deceptions, they prove right there that they haven't enough knowledge of the truth, nor a sense of discernment that is capable of even determining what is true or a lie. So who are you people to even judge the intelligence of those who will ultimately be proven to have known the truth regarding our origins, to the lies that you so proudly defend?   I say this only so you pseudo intellectuals will have some personal introspection to consider rather than just assuming that you'll get the correct answers by leaning on human understanding. It is incredible that you can't even see that you are bankrupt when you rely on unprovable assumptions that are based on preconceived notions, that have been both failing and conflicting with all of the new discoveries made in each generation to follow, thereby forcing the need to redefine the parameters by which evolution works every 10 years or so.   So evolution isn't a science, it's a working piece of fiction in progress that is constantly being tweaked and shaped to fit the preconceptions no matter what new evidence is discovered that contradicts it.",0

"The quad 50 full automatic anti-aircraft gun is designed to oscillate on it's mount. This is so that the bullets will come out in a pattern. This pattern along with tracer rounds helps the shooter guide the blizzard of bullets at the aircraft. Even this only works at low altitudes. Modern planes typically fly at ~30K feet. That's more than 5 miles high! A perfect bullet, or one that is fired in a vaccum with an initial velocity of 2800 fps will only go ~25k feet before gravity alone will have reduced it's velocity to 0 fps. The odds of hitting something that is moving at ~900 fps at any distance with a bullet traveling at ~2800fps are slim to none. That is why anti-aircraft guns are full auto, not a semiauto or anything that a citizen has access to legally.",0

"""refuted?""   O'rly?   First they start off defining evolution as ""moleclues to man"" despite what evolution actually states. That further proves my point about strawman. They don't discuss what evolution actually is. Furthermore, the whole notion that increasing capacity and adaption is not increasing complexity is insane. If I take a simple structure, modify it to form something more complex, is that not a change in complexity? The whole idea that modifying DNA, changing it, removing and adding isn't actually changing anything is retarded.   And they are separating macro from micro. That's an invalid argument given that macro is nothing more then the aggregate of micro. A billion tiny changes makes a few large ones.   The second idiotic article cites Natural genetic engineering.

The film suggests that evidence from ice cores proves that rising CO2 causes temperature increases over 650,000 years. The Court found that the film was misleading: over that period the rises in CO2 lagged behind the temperature rises by 800-2000 years.   3.	The film uses emotive images of Hurricane Katrina and suggests that this has been caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that it was “not possible�?to attribute one-off events to global warming.   4.	The film shows the drying up of Lake Chad and claims that this was caused by global warming. The Government's expert had to accept that this was not the case.   5.	The film claims that a study showed that polar bears had drowned due to disappearing arctic ice. It turned out that Mr. Gore had misread the study: in fact four polar bears drowned and this was because of a particularly violent storm.   6.	The film threatens that global warming could stop the Gulf Stream throwing Europe into an ice age: the Claimant's evidence was that this was a scientific impossibility.   7.	The film blames global warming for species losses including coral reef bleaching. The Government could not find any evidence to support this claim.   8.	The film suggests that the Greenland ice covering could melt causing sea levels to rise dangerously. The evidence is that Greenland will not melt for millennia.   9.	The film suggests that the Antarctic ice covering is melting, the evidence was that it is in fact increasing.   10.	The film suggests that sea levels could rise by 7m causing the displacement of millions of people. In fact the evidence is that sea levels are expected to rise by about 40cm over the next hundred years and that there is no such threat of massive migration.   11.	The film claims that rising sea levels has caused the evacuation of certain Pacific islands to New Zealand.

"Again with the common sense, but that is another issue alltogether. You're arguement that the brain is a fundamental unit of life is just plain wrong, considering the majority of all organisms don't have one. Bacteria, Protists, Plants, Fungi, and some animals are all without brains. Brains are required for motion and fast response to immediate changes in environment, for example a falling rock. Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.

"Actually just as many atheist help the needy.   Of course a person would need to be open-minded to realize it. Here is one such atheist charity. If you were open-minded about such things then you would have learned that both Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, who have each individually made the two largest charitable donations in American history, are both atheist (Oops, bet that's gotta kill your argument, huh?) and they can rightly claim credit for spurring many other ultra-rich to also be charitable.   Ted Turner, the multi-billionaire, has also donated millions to others, and guess what grizzly6626, he's an atheist too!   George Soros, also a multi-billionaire, financier and philanthropist, has also donated millions and is also an atheist. The list goes on and on. You just don't hear about these people donating because they tend to do these things quietly, and not with a lot of *cough* religious *cough* fanfare.   Didn't mean to wake you up grizzly6626   BTW - many catholic charities are known to turn the needy away. I've heard many accounts about how when some people first got married back in the 1970s, that catholic charities wouldn't help them out because they were not ""good, church-going catholics."" Basically because they didn't go to church every week (and put in their money filled envelope) the Church didn't consider them worthy of help.   You see, it isn't because religion makes people morally better than atheism. Rather, it would be because churches often organize charitable activities and encourage their members to participate, while atheists, simply have no comparable social structure. It's not that churchgoers have a superior moral sentiment, just that because of their increased social structure they naturally have increased opportunity.   There are countless amounts of people who are atheist that donate from the heart. They do not 'band together' into groups like religions do, and they do not advertise their charitable works like religions do, but they donate from the heart just the same. Here is a partial list of many such individuals who just happen to also be atheist. But it goes MUCH further than that though. There are a few organizations formed by atheists for the sole purpose of donating to those in need. One such organization is called S.H.A.R.E. - Secular Humanist Aid and Relief Effort. Here is a recent story about them helping those in need. So, when someone ignorant and closed-minded like grizzly6626 tries to convince you that 'only religions' donate or help those in need, you will now know that it's simply not true, and that people from all beliefs, even those that don't believe in God, help others in need and donate from their hearts, because they know it's the right thing to do for their fellow man in need",0
"believing that god doesnt exist or acknowledging the fact that evidence to support the existence of god has never been found does not equate to science being anti-religious or that science hates religion. in fact, the one thing that both science and religion have in common is acknowledging that belief in god is not based on observable evidence, but rather an individual choice to apply faith in something which cannot be seen or proven. on the one hand, religion continually reaches that in order to believe in god, you must have faith that god is real despite a marked lack of evidence for god's existence. science concludes the same thing: that people who believe in the existence of god do so solely by faith, despite the lack of observable evidence to back this belief   the bottom line is that science does not make religion obsolete by reiterating the fact that there is no evidence for god. religious people also already knows this, and believe in god regardless",0

"It depends on the particular situation. Some adoption agencies ask about it, and some don't. Most social workers who do home studies are aware that they have gay clients doing adoptions. Some adoptive gay parents are out about it, and some keep it quiet.   There are currently some foreign countries that require adoptive single parents to sign an affadavit that says, ""I am not homosexual."" Those are the rules of some foreign countries, notably China, not the United States or any state.   China has recently placed greater restrictions on prospective adoptive parents. They have sharply limited the opportunities for single people to adopt, and it looks like they may prohibit single-parent adoptions entirely. They have also instituted a weight requirement for all adoptive parents. In the case of a couple, their combined weight has to be below a certain figure or they are not allowed to adopt. No fat people allowed to adopt, which cuts out possibly most Americans.",0
"Well, in the case above, it was step-by-step. First, an existing enzyme was modified to a new use, and over time, became refined to work better and better. This is the way evolution works. Nothing is de novo; it's always a modfication of something else. Second, a mutation produced a regulator that only allowed the enzyme to be produced if the substrate was available. Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.   And do show us your numbers proving that such processes can't produce new information. If you don't know how, I'd be pleased to show you how a mutation changes the information in a population.",0
"(Note the key word ""also,"" which admits that it's human).   As for the rest, This is more of the sort of ""defensive rationalization"" I talked about earlier, i.e. when people find it more rewarding to self-righteously defend their wrongdoings and thus shirk their responsibility to others, than to shoulder the burdens to those they have harmed, and thus they act in self-absorbed narcissism and sociopathic dissociation, while likewise waxing arrogant in self-deceiving affirmation of their own ""brilliance"" and other superiority to do as they please, by simply denying said consequences however obvious-- illustrated here, by simply calling a fetus a ""parasite"" and thus daintily strutting off away from one's obvious duties to it, despite admitting it's also human.   However, a human being forced into dependency on another for its life, is not a ""parasite,"" but a VICTIM, and thus has the right to aid from the ones responsible for that dependency.   Since you've admitted that it's human, then the remainder is plain; it also has the right to aid from the one responsible for its dependency, i.e. the man and woman in question who proximately caused it to be in its dependent situation through their willful actions in full knowledge of that risk.   Here, the doctrine of Strict Liability would apply, in that normal sexual contact carries the inherent risk of pregnancy.   This doctrine already applies to men, and should likewise apply to women who choose to abort in spite of their responsibility to the prenatal human in question, created and made dependent on her for its life through her intentional actions.",0

"So are you saying that if one person prays for another person who is sick, that if the praying person believes enough then some power of belief within him is great enough to heal another person who has no such beliefs, but that isn't a miracle that can be attributed to God, but is just something the person praying accomplished because they believed enough ?   So when I laid hands on my 9 month old daughter and prayed for her healing in Jesus name, when she then within 5 seconds opened her eyes and went from completely listless with a 103 degree temp to wide awake, happy and affectionate as she smiled at me with bright little eyes, are you saying that something within me transfered to her to bring about that instant result ? If that is true, then you must admit that something supernatural still happened, it's just that the power to heal transfered from me instead of from God whom I asked to heal her in Jesus name.   Now mind you, I totally reject that, as I know it was God healing my daughter because I know rationally speaking, that I have no supernatural powers within me. And I truly understand how difficult it is for someone who has never personally experienced a miracle to not be skeptical about miracles or the supernatural, and maybe if I had experienced only one in my life then I too might question if it really happened.   But I have had numerous Angelic interventions that cannot be denied. And the personal spirit filled contacts with my heavenly Father on a daily basis is more than one such as I am can even fully appreciate or comprehend. Because you see, I am a sinner and completely unworthy to be in Gods presence at all, yet He has lived within me and fellowshipped with me each and every day of my life since I accepted Jesus as my Savior in August of 1975. And if you want to believe me, 2 of the Angelic interventions I experienced happened before I was even saved in August of 75. So as it is written, before the foundation of the World, God Knew me. And while I was yet in the womb, He knew me. And while I was in the womb, He knew the number of hairs on my head. So also, even before I accepted Jesus and was born again, my Father in Heaven knew me, loved me and protected me until the day of my salvation.   This is why I'm so adamant and stubborn in my belief and can not be moved by any unbelief. If I denied Jesus and Gods truth with all of the personal and first hand supernatural experiences I have had, I would be less worthy than the greatest evil doer and unbeliever in the world to receive Gods Grace and Love as I have. I have prophesied, spoken in the language of the Angels, been supernaturally saved from drowning, been saved from a violent attack which may have led to my murder as I had 5000 in cash on me at the time. But my Guardian Angel intervened and ran the muggers off and they never found the money. That was just one of the interventions and all I did when i saw the trouble coming was say within my mind, ""Lord Jesus, help me"". Nothing I did stopped the attack, nor could it have as these people had murder in their eyes. I had never seen such cold blooded hatred in any persons eyes before as was in this one guy. And yet within seconds I saw that rage in his eyes turn to abject terror as he looked past me, then he said to me, the next time I'll kill you and they ran away like total cowards. When I turned around to see who had scared them so much and looked exactly where they looked when they looked over my shoulder, you know what i saw ? Absolutely nothing. There was nobody there at all, no human anyway.",0

"You are distorting my view. I certainly do not think that I am ""god"" or that everyone has to revolve around my standard. However, I do think that morality has to have a rational basis behind it. This is my particular rational basis.   My moral code certainly isn't my own invention but is based on the moral codes which I have often heard expressed by others, as well as the moral code of the German philosopher Kant (often referenced in secular moral discussions). Most people from childhood are taught morals at least partly from the same points of view I use. After all, how often have you heard the phrase ""How would YOU like it if that happenned to you?"" or something similar. That is essentially the same as my basis of morality. It seems to be very common. Even many religions use a similar basic appoach - ""Do unto others..."". Of course, we all differ enough in our psychology that we might have some differences in how we would expect to be treated by others. So, this approach that I present would not lead to the same result in all people. Also, this approach depends on the capabilities of the person to see the big picture and to be able to fully see things from the other person's point of view. Since we are imperfect in these skills, it certainly helps to have moral discussions, moral mentors, etc. who can enlighten us in various situations. It is not a perfect method but at least it is not arbitrary since it is based on reason. Note that the famous German philosopher Kant gave a similar secular moral code in his Categorical Imperative: ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law"".   Your view doesn't seem to be based on reason but on a blind trust in a religious authority that tells you that a particular set of rules is right and must not be questioned. For those of us who do not hold the same beliefs as you, those rules often seem quite arbitrary. Sometimes some of the reasons behind those rules are illucidated, often not. Sometimes the rules are the same as those derived by secular reasoning, sometimes not.   Personally, I would prefer an imperfect moral code that at least is based on reason and is refineable to one that is immovable and based on arbitrary standards.   On a last note, there certainly could be moral codes that are based neither on religion nor on some version of the moral code which I have presented. If so, I would be quite interested in hearing them.",0

"1. From what I have learned, different locations breed different surroundings. Human ancestors were migratory pack animals. Where they went, they encountered new types of pressures, causing them to change over time.   2. Different selective pressures. Different areas can lead to different pressures. Some mutations also occured etc. Things like that.   Evolution doesn't HAVE to occure non-stop if there is equilibrium. Not everyting is always changing, as far as I learned. Barring mutations that cause significant changes over a lot of time, Apes, Chimps, Monkies wouldn't really change all that much. There's no real pressure to do so. They are already well-adapted to their surroundings.   Actually however, there really isn't that much difference between some of the great apes and Humans. Take the Bonobo Chimps, for example. They have 98% the same DNA as Humans. They are the closest to HOmo Sapien.   3. Niches. Related to above. Crocs, for example, don't evolve that much because they are a very successful animal design and they found a place in which they can thrive for generations with little to no changes. Other animals can do the same.   4. As well, humans didn't come directly from Apes. We all evolved from a common ancestor who did all of the above.   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/homs/species.html   Here is a time line of hominid species   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html   http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/speciation.html   Evolution doesn't lead to a higher species, as well. There is no hierarchy in nature. Each species is equally as well ""evolved"" depending on it's environment etc.   A Human is no more evolved than a Chimp or better than a Chimp.

But in doing this, the Court may have created a situation where plaintiffs can argue that California is denying people the equal protection of the laws, by allowing some people to be married to same-sex spouses and not allowing other people to be so married. If that is the argument that the plaintiffs make in their federal lawsuit, this could be interesting. The courts might have to interpret whether allowing some people to be married and not allowing other people to be married violates the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to the U.S. constitution. And then they might have to decide whether this means that all same-sex couples must have the right to marry, because some of them can be legally married. In other words, this situation may be an opportunity, because no one can argue that this is a case of apples and oranges of same-sex couples being different from opposite-sex couples.

"There are a few slight problems with that theory. First of all the evidence fits perfectly with that book you speak of. If predicts that all creatures came about suddenly and completely formed. This is all we have ever observed. The earliest creatures -according to your theories dating- had incredibly formed eyes etc. and no ancestors among the fossils   It also predicts that animals will produce the same kind of animals , this is all that has ever in the history of the world been observed.   +It predicts the heavens will show a perfect order and can be used for signs and for seasons and for days and for years. That is all that has ever been observed in the history of the world.   It predicts that recorded human history will be less that 10k years. That is what we observe.   It predicts that man has always been intelligent and ancient language and buildings confirm this.   It predicts that billions of fossils will be found in rock laid down by water all over the world, this we have observed.   It predicts there will be pathways in the sea, this is so.   It predicts that the heating of the air will create wind and this is so.   It predicts that the sea is the source of rain and it is so.   It predicted 800 years in advance that the Messiah the King would ride in to erusalem on a donkey to the exact day . That He would be crucified and his side pierced with a spear and cry out My God , My God why has thou forsaken me ?and it was so. It was predicted the ones who crucified him would cast lots for his garments and they did. That three days later He would rise from the dead and He did.   That DNA mutates does not prove anything other that it mutates. It is almost always harrmul or fatal and has never been observed to change one kind of an animal into another.   That the species that adapt to their environment survive and those that don't die is a self evident truth not evidence. About as intellectually stimulating as saying most things who fail to survive die.   Fossils exist. Now that is a brilliant statement. Why not say , water exist , or sand is?   All dating methods are based on circular logic. If the date agrees with the theory it is correct , if not it must be contaminated. It is based on an assumtion of the quantity of some radioactive substance in a material at some time in the past and how much has decayed when compared to the rate of decay gives us a date. Fortunately we already knew the earth was very old or evolution could not have occured. We know how old fossils are because of the rocks they are in and how old the rocks are by the fossils in the rocks. If the 2 are in the wrong place then we know there was an overthrust which is basically a miracle from God which is allowed because evolution needs it.   Life forms in the millions so therefore it must has started out as a random bunch of chemicals that created itself on a planet that created itself and evolved into the millions we see now. Another brilliant deduction. You are on a roll.   Believe our eyes. Oh you must mean all those times you are walking down the beach and trip all over the lobe finned fish coming on shore for the first time. Or the thousands of times we have seen a lizard with half a wing or a beaver giving birth to an armadillo. Yes , seeing is believing.   You present a brilliant argument.

"Let me try explaining this another way.   According to the logic presented in the original article:   Gun Owners : discrimination by gun control laws :: Serial Rapists : discrimination by anti-rape laws   You see, it's the RELATIONSHIP that I'm comparing. That's what an analogy is. I'm NOT comparing the gun owners to the serial rapists, but rather the RELATIONSHIP between discrimination and gun owners as presented in the original article and the RELATIONSHIP between discimination and serial rapists.   What do you mean ""my ultimate agenda""? I want regulation of the gun trade as there is regulation of the trade of every product with specific control laws that apply to each product. Does this mean a complete ban? No. Let's compare this to a drivers license. Yes I realize that's not a product, but it is regulated similar to the way guns should be regulated. It varies from state to state, but there is typically a driver's ed class, driving with an instructor, and a driving test. A person must pass all of these things before recieving a license. A person must also meet other qualifications such as vision requirements. Then, in my state, when a person recieves his or her license, it is only a provisional license, meaning that he or she cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. This lasts for eighteen months unless there are any moving violations, in which case the period starts over. These are all reasonable restrictions. These ideas can be applied to gun control. There could be gun training and gun tests. Background information such as prior criminal activities should be checked. Guns should not be made available at unregulated events such as gun shows. These sort of regulations are also similar to those on prescription drugs. A person must have a prescription from a real doctor, and he or she can only purchase or pick up the medicine from certified locations.   This is clearly not a fringe view since a large number of people support gun control. You may disagree with this view, but it clearly is not a fringe view. Nor is it a sign of mental instability.   The constitutionality of gun control is clearly debatable. It's not exactly simple. You can't ignore ""well regulate."" Even GunCite, a pro gun website, says, "" 'To put in good order' is the correct interpretation of well regulated, signifying a well disciplined, trained, and functioning militia."" Disciplining, training. That sounds like controlling. And if it was such a simple constitutional issue, why hasn't the Supreme Court made a difinitive ruling on it? If anything, it has ruled in favor of gun control, saying in the Miller case that ""The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with a view to its purpose of rendering effective the Militia."" Regardless, the constitutionality of a law does not make it wrong or right. Slavery was once allowed under the Constitution, but that did not make it wrong or right.   I never labeled your view as anarchistic. I said that UNLESS you are an anarchist, you are not in support of COMPLETE, 100%, ABSOLUTE freedom. What objective means are you using to determine that gun ownerships is a basic civil right?   First you assume that since I have liberal views on this subject, I agree with the actions of all other liberals, and second you assume that all other liberals commit the same actions. I have not once mentioned ""saturday night special."" My laws are meant to target all gun crime and gun accidents. Should we not have laws against gun crime (not laws against guns) because most gun violence is minority on minority. Sould we not have murder laws because a disproportionate number of murders are commited by minorities?",1

I do have a problem with people creating a feeling being and then killing it, as is the case when fetuses become sentient and are aborted. You also say that it is my opinion, which it is, but it is also your opinion. You have said that women who have abortion because they arn't responsible are making bad decisions.   First off, it's not punishment, it's taking responsibility for your actions. I have addressed the men, this is what I'm talking about, it was in my last post. Are you really reading the my posts? I said ""They(men) should have to raise the child also as they are equally to blame"". If I could take some of the birthing pain from women and give it to mwn, I would. The bottom line is that women know that if pregnancy occurs their will be pain, yet some do not protect themselves against it. Why would it then be my responsibility to take that pain into account? They accepted the risk when the didn't try to protect against it.   Yeah, like the one that I addressed the men in, right?   I have never said that we should punish 12 year old orphans. Show me where I said that. I said that the parents should help raise the child if they have the means. Would that put a slight damper on the 12 year olds social life? Probably, but she will be an adult soon enough and she should take some responsibility for her actions. The father should have to do the same. Why do you admit that the actions of the 25 year old are tragic but you don't want her to take responsibility?   How does being poor limit your responsibility to protect yourself? I know a poor woman who has 10 kids just hoping that one day she would find a man that would be willing to help raise the rest. Also, what do you mean by ""less fortunate? It never happened but she kept having kid after kid and hoping it would. Should she be excused for her behavior because she is poor? No, she kept going to BARS looking for good men. Bad choices = bad outcome. Do you think that this is proof that abortion is necessary? Nope, abortion IS NOT the answer in cases like this, only responsibility can solve the problem. The bad thing is that only one of the men do anything for the children and he doesn't do enough. She has never filed for child support and the kids are almost never disciplined.   I don't want to do anything as far as laws are concerned. I would recommend that she and the father raise the child, but sadly that may not happen.

"Because his, as a Christian, doesn't follow the Christian Bible to anywhere near the extent that mine does.   ""Quote mine"" - looks like that will be a common acusation here.

And that's all irrelevent, because pages 240-243 concern what happens in the world today, not what happened concerning creation. His feelings about God's interactions with the world today would be different if he had a basic knowledge of the Bible.   Even though the Bible says God did. His understanding of the Bible is very undeveloped and limited.   So you're implying that when he made his snide little comment about ""preachers"", he wasn't referring to priests?

Though it may not have been practiced to its fullness, it in no way follows that all men are not created equal.   Someone who actually had knowledge about the Civil War would certainly know that Lincoln did not believe the Union could be preserved unless slavery was abolished.   And I don't expect you to.

"So your claim is that the laws of physics have changed? You see, it is not a matter of design. It is a matter of the physical limits of wood. Wood is flexable, and the longer the piece of wood, the more bend there is in it. Possibly you have seen a roof with wood supports that spans a large area. To do it requires huge trusses unless you add column supports. And I'll bet there aren't any spans of over 300 ft. where only a wood truss is used.   For a ship/barge the problem becomes worse. If you make the keel thick in an effort to reduce the hogging and snaking, you reduct the room available inside. Even at that, it would be impossible to eliminate all of the flexing and that flexing would spring the planks of the hull. There is no calking that has been devised that can fill an ever changing gap between planks.   And, of course, recourse to a miracle is the standard creationist answer when faced with evidence that their mythology isn't historic. ""POOF! Goddidit!""

"You believe that your interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than his, and he believes that his interpretation of the Christian Bible is more correct than yours. This is quite simple, but that's never really helped you see the problem before...   Yeesh. Even when I spell it out, he still can't keep it straight.   No, marc, you're looking at the wrong quote. Try reading what I write.   Yes, you can expect accusations of quote mining to be common when you commonly quote mine. Say, do you think these two things could possibly be related?   ""Concise and readable"" takes a backseat to accurate. As I said, Miller overemphasizes views outside the mainstream of atheism and tries to paint all of atheism with the same brush. In fact, he picks a single atheist to spend three paragraphs on, then moves past his exaggerated claim. And with good reason.   marc's impeccable reading comprehension strikes again. marc thinks I was responding to a different point, despite the clear explanation of his ""citation about atheists using evolutionary findings to support their concepts.""   I figure it's his latest attempt at a dodge. Ignorance and incomprehensible babbling has gotten old to him, apparently.   Considering atheists don't believe in the supernatural, there's nothing else left. Now tell me how your truism actually means anything.   Lewontin did not say to forbid access to the Bible or other texts. You simply assume that he said that because you want to build as much of a strawman as you possibly can. See, if you had just quoted Lewontin instead of trying to censor his words, maybe you would have understood. ... Then again, probably not. I keep forgetting that your Persecution switch is fused in the ""on"" position.   Yes, Lewontin mentions the New York Times... the home furnishing supplement of the New York Times, in metaphoric comparison to the stage set of The Honeymooners. But you don't have a problem with your blatant misrepresentation, do you? No, no, anything to brainwash the kiddies and advance your delusion of massive conspiracy...   If Miller truly does understand Lewontin's point, he does a pisspoor job of explaining it. Lewontin says to eliminate the irrational and employ the intellectual. Frankly, I see nothing wrong with this; why do you?   The best case you'll ever be able to make regarding Lewontin's claims in this book is that he believes that a certain path to truth is the most effective. You claim that your path to truth is the most effective. Once again, we have no reason to believe either one of you over the other based on these statements alone.   Which Dawkins books that promote atheism (and by atheism, I mean atheism, not evolution) are required reading in public schools? Cite specific instances and include evidence that the ACLU rejected the cases.   This coming from the person who omitted so much that I had to elaborate on and quote from the book multiple times? No thanks, I'd rather make fun of your whining and your incomprehensible comprehension.   Oh, you didn't read the part where he distanced himself from atheism? The one where he explained that evolution is compatible with theism? I guess you missed it... It was only, you know, the vast majority of the book.   Oh, good, I get to do this again! They're not Christians, just like Judge Jones isn't a Lutheran. (Your foot should still be in your mouth over that one, but you never learn.) They're all phonies, aren't they, marc? Lucky for marc, he can accurately assess people's belief systems without knowing the slightest thing about their beliefs. But I have this ""power,"" too:marc is an atheist. Sure, he says all this fundie Christian stuff, but he's really an atheist. I know it in my heart because my own belief system, infallible and based upon the teachings of God himself, tells me so. I know, because I know Christians, and marc's not a Christian. He's just a big phony.   And there you go... atheist. Clearly, I've correctly labeled you, and you are nothing but a false teacher.Pathetic, marc. Absolutely, positively pathetic.   In other words, marc has absolutely no resolution to this conundrum except to leave us with this oh-so-powerful exchange:   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   *ahem*....   marc [about Miller]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Miller [about marc]: ""He'd think differently if he interpreted the Bible the same way I do.""   Yes, I'd speculate that he doesn't have such trouble ""stomaching"" priests. After all, he shares their beliefs, and not those of preachers of other (e.g. Protestant) sects, many of whom refuse to recognize Catholicism as truly Christian...   Keep on diggin', marc. I love helping you reach new lows.",1
